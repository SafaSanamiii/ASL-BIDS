TERMS OF USE
All Matlab code in OptProp is free. The only condition is that you do not claim
that you wrote it. There are a few routines, clearly denoted in the source code
that have not been originally written by Jerker Wågberg but to the best of the
author's knowledge, these routines are also free.
If the toolbox is used in academic work, it will be considered a nice gesture if
this fact is mentioned in the papers. To mention its use and particularly the
author's name at a conference might even be taken on as a challenge, in case
the audience have elementary knowledge of contemporary English. If it makes
it easier for you, it's pronounced 'yerker'…
Please refer to it as the OptProp toolbox by Jerker Wågberg, More Research
& DPC together with a reference to www.more.se, www.miun.se/dpc or the
Mathworks' File Exchange site, www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral .
Although a great deal of effort has been devoted to get the details right, the
author does not take any responsibility for any harm, economical or otherwise,
that might occur from using the results of this toolbox.
